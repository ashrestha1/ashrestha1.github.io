        <p><b>This project</b> aims to develop a system where users are able to shop much more efficently 
          in local markets through incorporating Botkit chatbot. <br> <br>
          <b>The goal</b> is to apply the concept of design process introduced in the lectures and gain hands-on
          experience through this project. We aim to resolve the needs stressed by disabled, foreign and senior citizens.

      <h2>Our learning and execution process</h2>

      <h2>Empathize</h2>



      <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
      <p>Our brainstorming resulted in grocery shopping in Hong Kong wet markets. This is because many of the 
        Hong Kong population rely on these markets for food as they are cheaper, reliable and very popular. As 
        some of us in the group are not familiar with Cantonese or mandarin, we have found it tedious to navigate through 
        the dense market filled with various satisfactory items. Moreover, we realised that the prominent supermarkets
         such as Wellcome and ParknShop are very organised concerning layouts due to being well-funded. Therefore we concluded 
         that the Wet markets, despite being cheap and practical for everyone in Hong Kong, is exhausting to shop thanks to
          the huge language barrier and along with the not so friendly directions illustrated by signs and paper maps.

      <h2>Interpret</h2>


      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p> We went to actual wet markets to get hands-on experience when walking around the complicated maze-like design. 
       <br><br>

       We took picture of different markets to study the different architecture that complicate many foreign, hearing-impaired and old citizens.

      <h2>Ideate</h2>
      <p>We looked at existing platforms such as Google Maps, and concluded there is a gap for providing locations
        of specific stalls in local markets. The local wet or night markets are very popular among Hong Kong citizens due 
        to the reliability and cheap prices. Moreover there is a need for users to compare shopping items all in one app instead
        of having to switch through different specific super market brand application.
       </p>
      
        <h3> Google Maps </h3>
        <blockquote> <p> Does not aid in finding stalls in the dense local markets found in Hong Kong.
        </p></blockquote>

        <h3> Super Market brand Apps </h3>
        <blockquote> <p> Useful for the supermaket the app is built for however is tedious to compare prices between different
          markets since you would have to shuffle through all the applications. 
        </p></blockquote>

        <h3>StoryBoarding</h3>

        <p>We used storyboards to illustrate the interaction that would occur between the user and the app.</p>

      <h2>Contribuition</h2>

      <h4>For the development of this application, I was responsible for coding the direction feature. 
        I constructed two approaches for generating the map that will help guide users to the designated stall or 
        provide users with the best route. </h4>

      <div id="overview">
        <p>
 

          For the first approach, I implemented an algorithim where the list of items wanted is observed and depending on 
          the items listed, a map will be generated with the fastest route to collect all the items in one go. 

          <img src="IMG/aiDemo.jpg">

        </div>
      </p>


      <div id="overview">
        <p>
          For the second approach, the user is provided with a map which features stalls that users can click on. The map will be reloaded with
          arrows drawn indicating the fastest route to the specified stall. 

          I used image mapping to ensure that users can interact with the map.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <blockquote> <p> From this project I gained valuable first-hand experience designing a chatbot,
         that I would not be able to get studying on my desk. 
         
       This project was abit difficult compared to the 1st project, as creating a unique feature through 
       incorporating chatbot was proven to be exhausting.  

       However by learning to construct POV of potential users we were able to come up with an idea. 
       My feelings concerning VR meetings and the design process remain the same as the last project development.

       Moreover, I learnt how to manage our time and coding workload as a group since in glitch we were able to code all at the same time. 
       Coding at the same time may prove to be tedious and be more prone to error due to confliction however with us practicing paitence and organisation we were able to resolve this potential risk.
