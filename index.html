        <h2>Our learning and execution process</h2>

        <h2>Empathize</h2>

        
          
            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>We explored prominent communication applications and tried to identify gaps in the market. <br> <br>
            After the first round of brainstorming, we concluded that we as a group wanted to shift our attention towards users that 
            struggle with technology in general. <br> <br>
            Our brainstorming resulted in senior citizens as our potential target users but found out that an alarming percent of seniors suffered from 
            some degree of hearing loss. We were concerned by the fact that there was lack of support for the deaf from communication applications,
            hence we ended up with shifting our target user to deaf people.</p>

          
        
          <h2>Interpret</h2>
        
          
            <h3>Constructed POV</h3>
            <p>Point-Of-View plays a critical part in understanding our target users. To try and empathize with our target users we conducted a mini-experiment.
              We decided to mute a live lecture video and attempt to follow the lesson, however we were <u>unable to comprehend</u> the slides shown and <u>lose attention</u>
              in a matter of minutes. <br><br>
              From this experiment we deduced the needs of our target users, which will be utilised to aid our design process.
            </p>
     

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>


        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
